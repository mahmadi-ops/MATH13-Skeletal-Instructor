  "body": " Preface  These are skeletal notes. Every section carries the definitions, the statements of the theorems, and the outline of each example and each proof but the details are left blank, and we fill them in together in class. What you are holding is the scaffolding of the course; the mathematics gets written into it as we do it.  So bring them with you. Before each class, print the section we are about to cover, or download it and annotate it on a tablet the PDF button in the navigation bar gives you the whole book as one file to print from. That file is rebuilt every time new notes are posted, so download a fresh copy rather than printing from an old one. Then complete the blanks in class as we work through the material. A page you filled in yourself is worth more later than any set of notes handed to you finished.  Everything for this course lives here: the notes themselves, the assignments, the review problems for each exam, and the solutions. Each item is added as we reach it, so check back regularly rather than assuming a page is final. Solutions to an assignment are posted only after its due date has passed; the review sets are posted the same way.  The problems are all in . There are ten assignments, which are graded, and four sets of review problems, which are not the review sets collect everything the assignments left over, and they are fair game on an exam. Assignments are due at 11:59 PM on the day shown below.     Assignments  Due day, at 11:59 PM    1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10  Friday    3, 6, 9  Wednesday (exam weeks 3, 6, and 9)     You hand your work in through Gradescope, not through this site. The steps how to upload a scan or a photo of your written solutions, and how to tell Gradescope which page holds which problem are under Submitting Your Assignments in Gradescope in the course syllabus. Read them once before the first assignment is due; a submission with the pages mismatched is the most common way points get lost for reasons that have nothing to do with the mathematics.  One more thing worth knowing before you start: each of the ten assignment pages carries a Socratic AI tutor that will coach you when you are stuck, without ever giving an answer away. How it works, what it will and will not do, and what to keep out of the chat are all set out in .  "

  "body": " *Hanging Cables and the Catenary   Starred section. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  If a heavy flexible cable (such as a telephone line, a power line, or a chain) hangs freely from two supports, it settles into a curve called a catenary . Contrary to a common guess, this curve is not a parabola; it is the graph of a hyperbolic cosine, where is measured horizontally from the lowest point of the cable, so that the -axis is the axis of symmetry and the lowest point sits at height . Sliding the curve up or down, as in , only changes where we draw the -axis.  The shape comes out of a balance of forces. Look at the piece of cable running from the lowest point to a point where the cable makes an angle with the horizontal, and let be the arc length of that piece. Three forces act on it: the tension at the lowest point, which is horizontal; the tension along the cable at the other end; and the weight of the piece, where is the mass per unit length; see . Balancing the horizontal and the vertical components gives    The three forces on the piece of cable of arc length running from the lowest point of the cable to a point where the cable makes an angle with the horizontal. The lowest point sits at height , and the supports are a distance apart.

Since the cable makes the angle with the horizontal, is its slope, so Now use the arc length element and separate the variables: where the constant of integration vanishes because at .  Solving for gives , and therefore One last integration, together with , produces the catenary equation .  Two things are worth noticing. First, is a pure scale factor: written as , the equation shows that every catenary is a scaled copy of the single curve , in exactly the same way that every circle is a scaled copy of the unit circle; shows four of them. Second, is fixed by the cable itself. If the cable has half-length and its two supports are a distance apart, then putting at in gives which determines (numerically) from the two lengths. Since , a cable pulled tight has a large and hangs almost flat, while a slack one has a small and sags sharply.   The catenaries for . Each curve meets the -axis at its own value of , and all four are scaled copies of the single curve . (After Fig. 2 of Behroozi, cited below.)     ca(x) = 0.5*(exp(x\/0.5) + exp(-x\/0.5))\/2  cb(x) = (exp(x) + exp(-x))\/2  cc(x) = 2*(exp(x\/2) + exp(-x\/2))\/2  cd(x) = 4*(exp(x\/4) + exp(-x\/4))\/2             a=0.5    a=1    a=2    a=4                A worked example of a hanging cable, in which we find the slope of the cable and the angle at which it meets its pole, appears in .  The derivation above follows F. Behroozi, In Praise of the Catenary , The Physics Teacher  56 , 214 217 (2018), which also discusses the sense in which all catenaries are similar to one another and suggests simple classroom demonstrations.

  "body": " Definitions of Taylor Series, Maclaurin Series, and Taylor Polynomials  In this section we will answer the following question:    If all we know about a function is information at , i.e. , how can we approximate with a polynomial ?     These are skeletal notes: the definitions and problem statements are given, and blank boxes are left wherever a derivation or a solution belongs, so that you can fill them in by hand.   Throughout, let be a function with derivatives of all orders throughout some interval containing as an interior point.  Before stating the definitions, let us see where the coefficients of such a polynomial have to come from. Suppose the only things we know about are its readings at : the value , the slope , the second derivative , and so on. We look for a polynomial written in terms of , and we pin down the unknown coefficients by requiring to agree with at in as many derivatives as it has coefficients. Writing it in terms of rather than is what makes this manageable: every term after the first vanishes at .  Work out the first few coefficients. In each row, differentiate the polynomial as many times as it has coefficients, evaluate at , and match against .     Blank box in three rows, for finding the coefficients of the linear, quadratic, and cubic approximations.    Notice what should not have happened: and should come out the same every time. Each new condition is the first one in which the next coefficient appears, so it determines that coefficient and leaves the earlier ones untouched. That is why is the tangent line with a single new term added to it, rather than a fresh approximation built from scratch. The pattern in the denominators should now be visible:   One computation settles every coefficient at once. Differentiate exactly times and evaluate at . Say what happens to the terms of degree below , to those of degree above , and to the term itself; then impose and solve for .     Blank box in two rows, for the kth derivative of the polynomial at a and the resulting coefficient.    So there is nothing to choose. Once we ask a polynomial to match and its first derivatives at , its coefficients are determined, and they are the numbers . Reading as and as , the first coefficient fits the same formula. Letting grow without bound leads to the following definitions.   Taylor Series   The Taylor series generated by at is      Taylor Polynomial of Order   The Taylor polynomial of order generated by at is the polynomial      Maclaurin Series  The centre is common enough to have its own name. The Taylor series generated by at is known as the Maclaurin series generated by , which is     Approximating near   Write down the Taylor polynomials of orders , , and generated by at .   Solution.

Each new term of the Taylor polynomial is grown in one at a time, so you can watch peel away from the previous approximation and settle closer to .      puts all of this on one screen for . The centre slider is the of the definitions: left at it builds the Maclaurin polynomials, and moved anywhere else it rebuilds the same construction at a new point, where again touches the curve. The order slider is the of , and stepping it up adds exactly one term, . That term vanishes at , which is why raising the order changes the shape of the polynomial everywhere else but never moves it off the point .  The green band in the figure is worth watching on its own. It marks the interval on which stays within of , and it widens with every term: about for , about for , and wider than the picture by . So the Taylor polynomials do not merely improve at the centre; the region where they are usable grows. Whether that region eventually covers everything, and how large the error is at a given , are the questions of the next section.  "

  "title": "Applications of Taylor Series and Remainder Theorem",
  "body": " Applications of Taylor Series and Remainder Theorem   We begin with two uses of Taylor series that belong to single-variable calculus: computing limits of the indeterminate form , which along the way gives a proof of L'Hôpital's rule, and approximating definite integrals whose integrands have no elementary antiderivative.  The remaining three parts of this subsection are starred. Physicists often use Taylor series to approximate functions in order to simplify calculations. The first example is the kinetic energy of an object in relativistic mechanics. The second example is the approximation of the period of a pendulum. We will discuss the error in using these approximations and when it is valid to use them. Additionally, we will discuss how to use the Taylor series to estimate the value of in the last example.    Computing Limits and Integrals with Taylor Series  Taylor's formula replaces a function near a point by a polynomial plus a remainder whose size the Remainder Estimation Theorem controls. That is exactly what two problems from single-variable calculus call for: a limit of the indeterminate form , where numerator and denominator both vanish and the question is how fast , and a definite integral whose integrand has no elementary antiderivative.  We will use two Maclaurin series. The series of was found in : The series of is it comes from the geometric series : since , and for , integrating this from to term by term gives .   A limit by Taylor series   Compute    Solution.      Blank box in four rows: the numerator and denominator as series, the factoring and cancellation, the limit, and why the remaining terms vanish.       Proving L'Hôpital's rule with Taylor's formula   Let and have continuous second derivatives on an open interval containing , with and . Use Taylor's formula to prove L'Hôpital's rule:    Solution.      Blank box in four rows: Taylor's formula for f and for g, the quotient after cancelling the common factor, the limit as x tends to a, and the second equality.       Why the rule sometimes has to be applied several times  If as well, the quotient is again of the form and L'Hôpital's rule has to be applied again. Taylor's formula explains what is going on. Suppose and have continuous derivatives near , their first derivatives vanish at , and . Then Taylor's formula with gives because each remainder is at most a constant times . The limit is the ratio of the first nonzero Taylor coefficients, which is exactly what applications of L'Hôpital's rule compute. In the first nonzero coefficients were those of . Check that , with and , agrees with the limit you found.    A definite integral with no elementary antiderivative   The function has no elementary antiderivative, so the integral cannot be evaluated with the fundamental theorem of calculus. Use the Taylor polynomial of order of to approximate , bound the error with the Remainder Estimation Theorem, and find a value of that guarantees an error of at most .   Solution.      Blank box in four rows: the series with its remainder and the bound on the remainder, the integration from 0 to 1, the error bound, and the choice of n.       A non-elementary integral computed exactly   In , term-by-term integration produced a series that we could only estimate . Sometimes, however, the series produced by term-by-term integration is one we already recognize, and then the integral can be evaluated exactly , even though the integrand has no elementary antiderivative. Show that    Hint. Each power of has to be integrated against on . Use the following fact from Calculus II, proved by integration by parts Let . Then . For , integration by parts with and gives , since as . By induction, . : for every integer ,    Solution. Integrating an infinite series term by term over the unbounded interval needs a justification, and the Remainder Estimation Theorem supplies one. Let be the partial sum of the series for , a polynomial of degree . For every derivative satisfies . The Taylor polynomial of of degree has no term, so it equals , and the Remainder Estimation Theorem gives . Dividing by , . Multiplying by , integrating, and using with , the integral differs from the partial sum by at most . This bound tends to as , so the partial sums of the Leibniz series converge to the integral. Since they also converge to , the integral equals . A numerical evaluation of the integral gives , which agrees with . The bound also shows why the Leibniz series converges slowly: to guarantee an error below we need roughly terms.

This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  In relativistic mechanics, the mass of an object moving with velocity is given by: where is the rest mass of the object and is the speed of light. Then the kinetic energy of an object of mass moving with velocity is:   In the case when , we can use the Taylor series to approximate the kinetic energy. In we will show that the kinetic energy can be approximated by the formula when . See for a comparison of the relativistic kinetic energy and its Newtonian approximation.   Relativistic versus Newtonian kinetic energy. The relativistic energy races toward a wall at the speed of light , while the Newtonian energy follows a gentle parabola; the two are approximately in agreement only when .

This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  We begin this section by briefly reviewing the forces acting on a simple pendulum and how the small-angle approximation allows us to treat its motion as simple harmonic motion.  The bob moves along the arc, so only the component of gravity tangent to that arc drives the motion. Resolving the weight into a component along the string ( , balanced by the string tension ) and a component tangent to the arc, as shown in , gives the restoring force   The minus sign indicates that the force always points back toward the equilibrium (straight-down) position. This is not Hooke's law: the force is proportional to , not to the displacement itself, so the motion is not exactly simple harmonic. Writing the arc displacement as , we would need to be proportional to that is, to for the motion to be simple harmonic.  The small-angle approximation bridges this gap. From the Taylor series when is small (in radians) the higher-order terms are negligible and . The restoring force then becomes which is Hooke's law with effective spring constant .  This is exactly what fixes the period. Newton's second law turns Hooke's law into the equation of motion Notice that the mass cancels. The equation says that is a function whose second derivative is a negative multiple of itself, and the functions with that property are the sines and cosines: writing , every solution has the form which you can verify by differentiating twice. The number is the angular frequency, and and repeat when increases by . So the motion repeats after a time with , giving   Thus, for small swings the pendulum behaves as a simple harmonic oscillator, with the period , which is independent of both the amplitude and the mass. Taylor's Remainder Theorem (see ) enables us to quantify how small must be for this approximation.   Forces on a simple pendulum. The weight resolves into a component along the string (balanced by the tension ) and a component tangent to the arc, which acts as the restoring force.     theta = radians(33)  fscale = 0.6  ft = 0.62  pivot = (0, 0)  bob = (sin(theta), -cos(theta))  mgEnd = (sin(theta), -cos(theta) - fscale)  ftEnd = (sin(theta) - ft*sin(theta), -cos(theta) + ft*cos(theta))  sinEnd = (sin(theta) - fscale*sin(theta)*cos(theta), -cos(theta) - fscale*sin(theta)*sin(theta))  cosEnd = (sin(theta) + fscale*cos(theta)*sin(theta), -cos(theta) - fscale*cos(theta)*cos(theta))          \\ell  \\theta   \\ell\\sin\\theta  x   \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{F}}_T   m\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{g}}   mg\\sin\\theta   mg\\cos\\theta   m                  Forces on a simple pendulum.

For small angles, gives .      Simple Harmonic Motion of a Pendulum as an Approximation   Use the remainder theorem to analyze the claim made in Giancoli's textbook that for small angles, .

It will not be examined.  In this subsection, we will discuss how to approximate the value of using Taylor series. We will use the Taylor series for , which centered at is    Approximating using the Taylor series for   Use the Taylor series for to approximate the value of . Use Taylor's Remainder Theorem to find an upper bound for the error in this approximation, and show that the error decreases as the order of the Taylor polynomial increases.   Solution.      Blank workspace for approximating pi with the arctangent series and bounding the error.    For the record: the derivatives of satisfy and the resulting error bound is The bound goes to zero as , but very slowly: to guarantee an error of at most one needs .     As we saw in the previous example, Taylor series approached very slowly. In the project below, we will see how to use the so-called Euler's formula to approximate much faster. As you may know, there are many other methods to approximate , which we will not cover here.   Computing with Euler's identity   In we approximated by evaluating the Taylor series at , and Taylor's Remainder Theorem gave the error bound , which decreases very slowly. In this guided problem we compute far more efficiently using Euler's identity  which lets us evaluate the Taylor series at the small arguments and , where it converges much faster.

We then measure distance, describe spheres, and practice translating between an equation and the surface or region it represents.  We will study the Cartesian coordinate system, which is also known as the rectangular coordinate system . We choose a point in space, called the origin , and three mutually perpendicular lines through it, called the coordinate axes and labelled the -, -, and -axis. A point in space is then described by an ordered triple , where , , and are the signed distances from the origin along the three axes.  On the axes below, mark off units along the -axis, then units parallel to the -axis, then units parallel to the -axis, and label the point you reach.     Empty set of three-dimensional coordinate axes labelled x, y, and z, meeting at the origin O, for plotting the point P with coordinates a, b, c.

Deciding whose taste resembles whose can be framed as a geometry problem, and one tool that can help us decide is the dot product.  The first step is to turn taste into a vector. Fix a list of movies and ask each person to rate every one of them on a scale from to , where means loved it , means I want those two hours back , and means indifference. Reading the ratings off in the same order for everybody turns each person into a vector, and the question do these two people have similar taste? becomes a question about the angle between two vectors, which by is exactly what the dot product measures.   Angular Distance and Cosine Similarity   Let and be two nonzero vectors. Their angular distance is the angle between them, obtained from , The quantity appearing inside is called the cosine similarity of and . The smaller the angular distance, the more similar the two vectors.    Angular distance asks how nearly do these two vectors point the same way? Notice that it is completely blind to the lengths of and : multiplying either vector by a positive number leaves untouched. We will come back to what that means for moviegoers.   Two Movies at a Time  Two movies give vectors in , which we can draw. Take two of the ten films nominated for Best Picture at the 2026 Academy Awards, Sinners and Hamnet , and record each person's rating of Sinners as the first component and of Hamnet as the second.

The angular distance of carries over verbatim:   We can no longer draw the picture, but every formula still applies, and the language of still means something: two taste vectors with are orthogonal, an angular distance of , which here says that knowing one person's ratings tells you nothing about the other's.

  "body": " Application: Torque  One of the well known physical applications of the cross product is torque , the rotational analog of force. A force makes an object accelerate; a torque makes it rotate . How effective a force is at producing rotation depends not only on its magnitude, but also on where it is applied and in what direction . Think of pushing a door: pushing hard near the hinge barely moves it, while a light push at the doorknob swings it open easily. Pushing at the doorknob but toward the hinge does nothing at all. The cross product captures all three scenarios and more.   Torque   Suppose a force is applied at a point whose position vector relative to the axis of rotation is . The torque produced by is the vector       Interactive view of . The force is applied at the head of , and the torque points along the axis of rotation.     Everything we know about the cross product now translates into physics. By , the magnitude of the torque is where is the angle between and , and the direction of is given by the right-hand rule: points along the axis of rotation, and curling the fingers of the right hand from toward gives the sense of the rotation. Torque has units of meter-newtons ( ) in SI.  The quantity in can be grouped in two useful ways, shown in . Write down the two groupings.     Blank box in three rows, for the torque grouped as force times lever arm, for the torque grouped as distance times perpendicular force, and for the reason the two agree.     The two groupings of .

The second, shown in , says it is the distance times , the component of the force perpendicular to ; the parallel component points straight at the axis and produces no rotation.

  "body": " Application: Circular Motion: Velocity and Angular Velocity   A second physical application of the cross product describes the motion of an object travelling in a circle: a rider on a circular track, a ball whirled on a string, a point on a spinning wheel, or the moon on its (nearly circular) orbit. In each case the object turns about a fixed centre, and the natural way to keep track of where it is at time is not by its coordinates and but by the single angle it has swung through. Our goal is to study how the velocity and the rate of change of that angle are related.    A Frame that Turns with the Particle  Let an object move on a circle of radius centred at the origin of the -plane, and let be the angle its position makes with the positive -axis at time , as in . At the point where the particle sits we attach two unit vectors:    , pointing radially outward, away from the centre, and     , perpendicular to and tangent to the circle, pointing in the direction of increasing .      The moving frame at the point : points radially outward and is tangent to the circle. The fixed vectors and are drawn at for comparison; unlike and , they do not turn as the particle moves.    A circle of radius r centred at the origin. A particle sits at a point P on the circle, its position vector making an angle theta of t with the positive x-axis. At P the unit vector r hat points radially outward along the position vector, and the unit vector theta hat is perpendicular to it, tangent to the circle in the counterclockwise direction. The fixed unit vectors i and j are also drawn at P for comparison.              \\theta(t)    P  r   \\hat r(t)    \\hat\\theta(t)   \\hat{\\imath}  \\hat{\\jmath}  +x  +y                Read the components of the moving frame off , and write down the position vector.

Blank box in three rows, for the components of the radial unit vector, for the components of the tangential unit vector, and for the position vector together with the cross product that checks the frame is right-handed.     The Moving Frame      The pair , is fixed once and for all, while the pair , rides along with the particle and turns as it goes; this is exactly what makes the second pair convenient.

The displacement is the chord subtending the angle . For small the chord is nearly the arc, , and its direction approaches that of the tangent line, along which points.    Two position vectors of equal length r are drawn from the centre of a dashed circle, separated by a small angle delta theta. The chord delta r joins the tip of the first to the tip of the second.

But a rotation has a direction as well as a rate: the plane of the circle can be tilted any which way, and the particle can go around it either way. Both pieces of information can be carried by a single vector, provided we point it along the axis of rotation rather than along the motion.   Angular Velocity Vector   For an object moving in a circle in the -plane about the origin, the angular velocity vector is directed along the axis of rotation. Its SI units are , and the angular speed of is its magnitude, .    The sign of records which way the object goes around, and the right-hand rule turns that sign into a direction in space: curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the motion and your thumb points along . The two cases are shown in .   The angular velocity vector points along the axis of rotation, in the direction given by the right-hand rule: up the -axis for counterclockwise motion (left), down it for clockwise motion (right). Note that is not tangent to the orbit the velocity is.    Two panels showing a particle on a circular orbit in the horizontal plane, drawn in an oblique view with the z-axis vertical. In the left panel the particle circulates counterclockwise as seen from above and the angular velocity vector points up along the positive z-direction. In the right panel the particle circulates clockwise and the angular velocity vector points down along the negative z-direction. In both panels the velocity is tangent to the orbit.     orbA(t) = (2.2*cos(t), 0.75*sin(t))  orbB(t) = (7.4 + 2.2*cos(t), 0.75*sin(t))             \\overrightarrow{\\omega}   +z  O   \\overrightarrow{r}    \\overrightarrow{v}    \\omega_z = \\dfrac{d\\theta}{dt} > 0    \\text{counterclockwise:}\\;\\; \\overrightarrow{\\omega} \\text{ points along } +\\hat{k}             \\overrightarrow{\\omega}   +z  O   \\overrightarrow{r}    \\overrightarrow{v}    \\omega_z = \\dfrac{d\\theta}{dt} < 0    \\text{clockwise:}\\;\\; \\overrightarrow{\\omega} \\text{ points along } -\\hat{k}                      Velocity as a Cross Product  We now have two vectors attached to the motion: the angular velocity , along the axis, and the position , in the plane of the circle. The velocity is perpendicular to both, which is precisely the job of the cross product.   Velocity and Angular Velocity   For an object in circular motion about the origin,     Verify .     Blank box in two rows, one for the cross product of k hat with r hat and one for the verification that omega cross r is the velocity.

Blank box in three labelled rows, for the magnitude, the direction, and the sense of the velocity read off the cross product.    There is a bonus. A piece of running along the axis is parallel to and so contributes nothing to the cross product, since . Consequently remains true when is measured from any point on the axis of rotation, not just from the centre of the circle.   The velocity of a particle in circular motion is . Because and are perpendicular, the speed is , and the right-hand rule places tangent to the orbit in the direction of travel.    A circular orbit in the horizontal plane drawn in an oblique view, with the z-axis vertical. The angular velocity vector points straight up along the z-axis from the centre O. The position vector runs from O out to the particle on the orbit, and the velocity vector at the particle is tangent to the orbit, equal to the cross product of the angular velocity with the position vector.     orb(t) = (2.6*cos(t), 0.9*sin(t))            \\overrightarrow{\\omega} = \\dfrac{d\\theta}{dt}\\,\\hat{k}   +z  O   \\overrightarrow{r} = r\\,\\hat r    \\overrightarrow{v} = \\overrightarrow{\\omega}\\times\\overrightarrow{r}                   Examples   Angular velocity from an angle function   A particle moves in a circle of radius centred at the origin of the -plane; at it is on the positive -axis.

The constant-sum definition ( ) explains why it works so well. Every path from one focus to the wall and on to the other focus has the same total length, no matter where it strikes. So the reflected sound does not merely arrive at the far focus: it arrives from every direction at the same instant , in phase, and the pieces reinforce one another instead of smearing out. That is what makes a whisper audible across the room.  Write down that common length, and say why the phrase in phase is the key to the effect.

One example is LORAN-C marine navigation, developed in the United States during World War II. A vessel receives a synchronized signal from a pair of transmitters; the signal from the more distant transmitter arrives later, so the measured delay determines the difference between the vessel's distances to the two transmitters, where is the signal speed.  Say what that single measurement tells the vessel, and what a second one adds.     Blank box in three rows, for the curve a single delay determines, for what the sign of the delay adds, and for what a second measurement contributes.     Hyperbolic navigation.

  "title": "Quadric Surfaces in the World",
  "body": " Quadric Surfaces in the World  The surfaces of this section are more than abstract shapes. Each one appears in the physical world, and often it appears because of the very geometric properties we have been discovering by slicing.   Elliptical paraboloid. A paraboloid has a striking reflective property: every ray travelling parallel to its axis bounces off the surface and passes through a single point, the focus. This is why the dishes of radio telescopes and satellite receivers, and the reflectors behind car headlights and solar concentrators, are shaped like paraboloids they gather parallel incoming rays to one point, or, run in reverse, send rays out in a single parallel beam. The benefit is sensitivity: because parallel rays converge on the focus no matter where they strike the surface, enlarging the dish simply gathers more of a faint signal onto the same receiver, letting a radio telescope detect fainter and more distant objects. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory explains how a parabolic dish bounces incoming radio waves to a focus .   The dishes of the Very Large Array are elliptical paraboloids, focusing incoming radio waves onto a single receiver. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0.)   A row of large white parabolic radio-telescope dishes on a desert plain.     Hyperbolic paraboloid. The saddle is doubly ruled : through every point pass two straight lines that lie entirely on the surface, just like the flat traces the two crossing lines in the plane  that appear when we slice it in . A doubly curved roof can therefore be built out of straight beams, or poured over straight formwork, which makes the hyperbolic paraboloid both strong and inexpensive to build. It is the shape of many saddle roofs and of Félix Candela's thin concrete shells and, on a smaller scale, of a Pringles potato chip. The benefit is efficiency: a thin shell of this shape carries its load by compression and tension acting within the surface rather than by bending, so it can roof a very wide span with only a few inches of material. Encyclopaedia Britannica's article on shell structures describes how such curved roofs are engineered from straight lines.   The roof of the Scotiabank Saddledome in Calgary is a hyperbolic paraboloid. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0.)   A large arena whose roof dips in the middle and rises at the sides like a saddle.     Ellipsoid. An ellipsoid has two focal points, and a wave leaving one focus reflects off the surface straight toward the other. In a whispering gallery a whisper at one focus is heard clearly across the room at the other; in medical lithotripsy a shock wave generated at one focus is focused onto a kidney stone placed at the other, breaking it apart without surgery. On the largest scale, the Earth itself is modeled as a slightly flattened ellipsoid the reference ellipsoid against which GPS coordinates are measured. The benefit of this two-focus focusing is precision without contact: a lithotripter can concentrate its energy on a stone deep inside the body while sparing the surrounding tissue. Modeling the Earth as an ellipsoid brings a different benefit a single smooth equation captures its slight flattening, giving GPS a far more accurate reference than a sphere would. NOAA's National Geodetic Survey describes the reference ellipsoids that anchor those coordinates.   The Earth is modeled as an oblate ellipsoid, the reference surface behind GPS coordinates. (Image: NASA.)   A photograph of the whole Earth from space, very nearly spherical but slightly flattened.     Elliptic cone. When an aircraft flies faster than sound, the pressure waves it creates pile up into a cone that trails behind it, the Mach cone. The sonic boom you hear is the instant this cone of compressed air sweeps past you. This cone is not a design choice but an unavoidable consequence of the motion; even so, its geometry is informative: the sine of its half-angle equals , where is the Mach number, so a narrower cone means a faster aircraft. NASA's Glenn Research Center describes how supersonic disturbances stay confined within this cone .   A fighter jet at transonic speed, wrapped in a cone-shaped condensation cloud that traces out the Mach cone. (Photo: U.S. Navy.)   A jet in flight enveloped by a cone-shaped white cloud of condensed water vapor.     Hyperboloid of one sheet. Like the saddle, this surface is ruled  recall the two straight-line traces we found in the planes in . Because straight members can be arranged to sweep out its double curvature, it can be built cheaply from straight beams or straight formwork while remaining very stiff. This is exactly why the cooling towers of power plants, and open lattice towers such as Vladimir Shukhov's, are hyperboloids of one sheet. The benefit is that stiffness and wind resistance come almost for free: because the surface is ruled, the whole tower is assembled from straight, easily fabricated members, so it reaches great height with remarkably little material. The University of Houston's Engines of Our Ingenuity tells the story of Shukhov and these ruled towers.   A power-plant cooling tower is a hyperboloid of one sheet, assembled from straight structural members. (Photo: Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0.)   A tall concrete cooling tower that narrows to a waist in the middle and flares out at the top and bottom.     Hyperboloid of two sheets. Like the ellipse, a hyperbola has two foci, and a ray aimed at one focus reflects toward the other. Reflecting telescopes of the Cassegrain and Ritchey Chrétien type including the Hubble Space Telescope use mirrors ground to hyperboloidal shapes to fold a long optical path into a short tube. The same two-focus idea drives hyperbolic navigation : comparing the arrival times of two signals places a receiver on a hyperboloid, and intersecting several such surfaces is how systems from LORAN to GPS pin down a location. The benefit is sharpness in a compact instrument: the paired hyperboloidal mirrors fold a long focal length into a short tube and cancel the aberrations that would blur a simpler design, keeping Hubble's images crisp across its whole field of view. NASA explains how these curved mirrors gather starlight in its overview of the Hubble Space Telescope's optics .   The Hubble Space Telescope focuses light with hyperboloidal mirrors.

  "body": " Scalar Fields, Potentials, and the Direction Nature Chooses  A scalar field is a rule that assigns a single number to every point of a region: the temperature in a city, the pressure over an ocean, the elevation on a hillside, the concentration of a pollutant in a corridor. A scalar field carries no direction of its own. It is only a number at each location.  Physics, by contrast, is full of quantities that point somewhere: heat flows, forces push, wind blows. These are vector fields . The gradient is what ties them back to scalar fields at least for the conservative fields taken up in MATH 14 at SCU, where the whole vector field is recovered from a single scalar potential by differentiation. Because such fields are so common in nature, the pattern in the table below appears again and again across physics.  When a scalar field governs a physical force or flux, we call the field a potential , and the associated vector quantity is, up to a constant, the negative gradient of that potential.    Setting  Scalar field  Vector quantity  Level curves are    Heat conduction  temperature  heat flux (Fourier's law)  isotherms    Electrostatics  potential  electric field  equipotentials    Mechanics  potential energy  conservative force  contours of constant energy    Meteorology  pressure  pressure-gradient force per unit volume  isobars    The minus sign in each of these laws encodes one physical fact: nature moves downhill . Heat drains from hot to cold, charges move toward low electric potential, a ball rolls toward low gravitational potential energy, air accelerates toward low pressure. So the direction the physics actually selects is the direction of most rapid decrease , which is exactly the case of .  Three consequences carry over unchanged from , and they are worth restating in physical language.      : fastest increase, at the rate . This is the direction heat comes from .     : fastest decrease, at the rate . This is the direction the flux, the force, or the wind actually points.     : no change at all. These directions trace the level curves of the field isotherms, equipotentials, isobars, the contour lines on a topographic map.

  "body": " Estimating the Change in a Particular Direction  Before turning to functions of two variables, it is worth recalling the analogous idea from single-variable calculus. For a differentiable function , moving a small distance away from a point changes the height of the curve by an amount that can be estimated from the slope : the resulting differential is As shows, this differential closely approximates the actual change in the function, , as long as is small.   The tangent line at approximates near . The differential , found by walking along the tangent line, closely approximates the actual change , found by walking along the curve.    The graph of a curve y equals f of x. At a point x on the curve, a right triangle formed by the tangent line has horizontal leg d x and vertical leg d f, equal to f prime of x times d x. A separate vertical bracket to the left, labeled delta f, compares this to the actual rise of the curve, f of x plus d x minus f of x, and a bracket to the right shows the differential d f equals f prime of x times d x next to the baseline height f of x.     curve(t) = (t, exp(0.35*t))                     x  y   y=f(x)   x   x+dx   f(x)   f(x+dx)    dx    df=f'(x)\\,dx    \\Delta f    f(x)                The same question arises for a function of two variables. The difference is that near a point in the plane there is no longer a single direction to move in moving away from a point requires both a distance and a direction. Consider the function , a point in its domain, and a unit vector . The question is:    How can we estimate the change in ( ) as a result of moving a small distance ( ) away from in the direction ?    Answer the question by following the displacement. (Write the displacement of length in the direction in components, add it to to name the point it reaches, and write down the change it causes in the value of . Check the length of your displacement vector: it has to come to . Then follow it in .)

The horizontal axis is the distance s travelled from P 0 in the direction of u, running from 0.05 to 0.15 rather than from 0, so that the two graphs are far enough apart to be told apart; the vertical axis is z, running from about 3.13 to about 3.46. A black curve is the value of f along u, and a blue dashed line is its tangent line at P 0. The line stays just below the curve and the gap between them widens to the right. At s equals d s equals 0.1, dashed guide lines pick out the two heights: the tangent line reaches the blue point at 3.283, the estimate 3 plus d f, and the curve reaches the orange point at 3.293, the exact value of f at the moved point. A callout labels the gap between the two points as delta f minus d f equals 0.01. A legend below the picture names the curve, the tangent line, and the two marked values.      "

  "body": " Why the Second Derivative Test Works  Where do the conditions of come from? The key idea is to take the directional derivative twice . At a critical point every direction looks flat to the first derivative, so we ask the second derivative how the surface curves as we walk away from the point in each direction. The video animates the argument; the equations that appear in it are the ones you will derive below.   Slicing a surface through a critical point in a rotating unit direction . The second directional derivative is the curvature of the slice: one sign for all directions gives a local extremum, both signs give a saddle point, and completing the square shows that the discriminant decides between the two.      Slicing the surface in a direction  Suppose has continuous first and second partial derivatives near a critical point , so that . Fix a unit vector and walk away from the critical point along the line through in the direction of . Write down the height of the surface above that line as a single-variable function . (Parametrize the line as in , then feed it into . This is the slice cut by the vertical plane through containing .)     Blank workspace for the single-variable function that gives the height of the surface along the line.       The first directional derivative  Differentiate once, and evaluate at the critical point. (Use ; the two inner derivatives are constants, read straight off the parametrization. Recognize the result as something already named in . Then set and use the hypothesis the answer is the same for every  , which is exactly why one derivative cannot tell the three cases apart. Say that in a sentence.)     Blank box in three rows, for the first derivative of the slice, for its value at the critical point, and for why that value settles nothing.       The second directional derivative  Differentiate once more. (Apply the chain rule to each of the two terms of , remembering that and are themselves functions of and . Four second partials appear, but lets two of them be combined; the result is a quadratic in and .)     Blank box in two rows, for differentiating the first directional derivative and for the resulting quadratic expression.     The Second Directional Derivative      The number is the curvature of the slice at the critical point. Say what its sign means, and then what the single-variable second derivative test, applied to , gives in each of three cases. (A positive value means the slice is concave one way, a negative value the other. Then ask what must be true across all directions for a local minimum, for a local maximum, and for a saddle.)     Blank box in four rows, for the meaning of the sign of the second directional derivative and for the condition across all directions in each of the three cases.    Writing turns into a function of the direction angle alone. Write it down, and evaluate it for the three surfaces of . (Two of the three come out constant in , which is the whole story for those surfaces; the third does not, and a double-angle identity puts it in a form where you can count how often it changes sign in a full turn.)     Blank box in two rows, for the second directional derivative as a function of the direction angle and for its value on each of the three sample surfaces.       Completing the square: the discriminant appears  Checking the sign of one direction at a time is impossible; there are infinitely many directions. Instead, assume , multiply by , and complete the square in . (Multiplying first is what makes the square come out with integer coefficients. Group the and terms into a perfect square, and see what has to be added back. Check your work by expanding the square again.)     Blank box in three rows, for the product with the second partial derivative, for completing the square, and for the check.     The Completed Square      Now say what has been gained.

Blank box in two rows, for the coefficient that is not a perfect square and for the two numbers that control the sign in every direction.       Reading off the four cases  Work through the three cases from .  (For : both terms on the right are non-negative, and they cannot vanish together check the two possibilities and separately. Conclude that has a fixed sign, and say which. Note also that rules out ; show why.)  (For : the two terms now compete, so find two directions giving opposite signs. One is ; for the other, choose so that the perfect square vanishes the bracket in tells you which direction that is.)  (For : what does collapse to, and in which direction does it vanish? Say what the second derivative can and cannot tell you there.)     Blank box in three labelled rows, one for each case of the sign of the discriminant.    These are precisely conditions (i) (iv) of . One technical remark: the argument above examines only straight-line slices through , which by itself is not quite enough (a function can increase along every line yet fail to have a local minimum). The full proof replaces near by its second-order Taylor expansion; continuity of the second partials guarantees that when the quadratic form keeps its sign uniformly on a small disk around , which upgrades the line-by-line conclusion to a genuine local one.

Here adding the two component equations is what unlocks the system: it factors, and one of the two cases it offers is impossible substitute that value of back and say what goes wrong. The other case plus the constraint gives the points; evaluate there using , and say why these are the absolute extrema.)     Blank box in five rows: the two gradients, the component equations, the equation obtained by adding them together with the case that has to be ruled out, the points found from the constraint, and the values of the function with the absolute extrema.

  "body": " Functions of Variables    The Method in Variables  Nothing in the reasoning behind depended on the inputs being two or three numbers. The constraint still describes a set of points on which we are allowed to move; is still perpendicular to that set; and at a constrained extremum still cannot be changing along any direction we are allowed to move in, so can have no component tangent to the constraint set. As before, the only way for a vector to be perpendicular to every allowed direction is for it to point along . So the method reads the same way for any number of variables.   The Method of Lagrange Multipliers in Variables   Let and be differentiable functions of the variables . To find the local maximum and minimum values of subject to the constraint , find the values of and that simultaneously satisfy the equations     Here the gradient has components, and likewise for . Reading one component at a time turns it into which together with is a system of equations in the unknowns . For and this is exactly . The bookkeeping grows, but the strategy does not: eliminate , solve for the candidate points, and then compare the values of there.  One habit does need adjusting. In and the constraint curve was closed and bounded, so the Extreme Value Theorem guaranteed in advance that the absolute maximum and minimum existed and were among the candidate points. In variables a constraint set is often unbounded, and then no such guarantee comes for free: after solving the system we must argue separately that the point we found really is the extremum we are after. The example below does exactly that.     An Inequality Between Two Means  Our last application of the method is not an optimization problem at first sight: it is an inequality, valid for any number of positive numbers, which turns into a constrained optimization problem as soon as the right quantity is held fixed. For positive numbers , the harmonic mean and the geometric mean You are not expected to have met these averages before, and nothing later in the course depends on them. The arithmetic mean  is the ordinary average. The geometric mean  is the number that, repeated times, has the same product : for it is the side of a square with the same area as an -by- rectangle, and it is the right average for growth factors, since an investment that grows by factors in successive years grows in total as though it had grown by the constant factor each year. The harmonic mean  is the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals, and it is the right average for rates: drive one mile at mph and the next at mph and your average speed over the two miles is the harmonic mean mph, not the arithmetic mean mph. are The example below proves that always, with equality exactly when all the numbers are the same. If you are curious about where these two averages come from, and about what the inequality amounts to for two numbers, where it can be both checked by hand and seen in a picture, read after the example; it is optional.   The Harmonic Mean Never Exceeds the Geometric Mean   Let and let be positive real numbers. Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to prove that that is, , with equality if and only if .   The difficulty is that both sides vary at once. The remedy is to hold the right-hand side still: depends on the numbers only through their product, so it is constant on each surface where that product is constant. Write for that product, fix a constant , and work on on which at every single point.   Proof. (Say why proving the claim on one such proves it for every list of positive numbers. Then turn maximize into a minimization: for a quantity you should name, and is positive, so the two problems have the same solution. State the constrained problem you are about to solve.)     Blank box in three rows: why working on a single constant product surface suffices, the quantity whose reciprocal gives the harmonic mean together with the reason maximizing one minimizes the other, and the statement of the constrained problem.     The minimum exists, and the method can find it. (Two ways of drifting to the edge of have to be ruled out: one coordinate going to , and one going to infinity remember that the product is pinned at , so the second drags another coordinate along with it. Show that grows without bound in both cases. Then compute , simplify each entry using , and check that it is never on .)     Blank box in two rows, one for the behavior of the sum of reciprocals near the two kinds of boundary and the conclusion that a minimum is attained, and one for the gradient of the constraint function on the surface with the reason it never vanishes.     Solving the system. (Apply to and . Differentiating with respect to leaves the product of all the other factors; multiplying the resulting equation through by restores the missing factor and leaves one spare copy of , so the whole product appears. Note what would say, rule it out, and then solve for . The answer does not depend on  that is the point so use the constraint to pin down the common value.)     Blank box in four rows: the k th component equation of the multiplier condition, the same equation cleared of fractions, the argument ruling out a zero multiplier together with the solution for each coordinate, and the single Lagrange point on the surface.     Finishing. (Evaluate at that point and turn it into a value of ; compare with . Then explain why every other point of gives a strictly larger , and so a strictly smaller  there is only one Lagrange point. Finally, say which an arbitrary list of positive numbers lies on, and read off together with its equality case.)     Blank box in three rows: the values of the sum of reciprocals and of the harmonic mean at the Lagrange point, the reason every other point of the surface gives a strict inequality, and the final statement of the claim with its equality case.     One last observation costs nothing and doubles the yield. (Apply not to the numbers themselves but to their reciprocals . Work out what the harmonic mean and the geometric mean of the are in terms of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean of the , then invert the resulting inequality both sides are positive, so the direction flips.)     Blank box in two rows, one for the harmonic and geometric means of the reciprocals expressed through the means of the original numbers, and one for the inequality that follows.     The Three Means  Applying to the reciprocals gives the celebrated inequality between the geometric and arithmetic means, again with equality exactly when all the are equal. Together with the example this establishes the full chain for any number of positive numbers the general form of what shows for two.    For the Curious: the Two-Variable Case and a Picture  This remark is optional, and nothing later in the course depends on it. It is here for the reader curious about what the inequality just proved actually says. For two numbers it can be checked with nothing but algebra and, better, read off a single picture, along with the arithmetic mean for good measure.  For no calculus is needed at all. Write the two positive numbers as and . Then and since and we may multiply and divide freely without reversing the inequality: where the second line divides through by , using . The last line is true for every choice of and , and it is an equality exactly when , that is, when .  The middle line of that chain is worth a second look. It says , so for two numbers the statement is the very same statement as , where is the arithmetic mean. The two-variable case therefore carries the whole chain on its own, without any appeal to .  All three means can be read off a single picture, and the geometric mean is the interesting one. It comes from a fact about right triangles: the altitude drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse is the geometric mean of the two pieces into which it cuts the hypotenuse. In the right angle is at , the altitude has length , and it splits the hypotenuse into pieces of lengths and . The two small triangles and are both similar to the whole triangle , hence to each other, so matching the short leg of one against the long leg of the other gives   Now lay the two lengths and end to end and draw the semicircle having the resulting segment as its diameter, as in .

The series telescopes. The partial sum is Hence the series converges and     We split the series into two geometric series: Since , by the th term test we can conclude that the series diverges.         Determine whether the series converges, and if so find its sum:     Note that since . Indeed, setting and , Therefore, the series diverges by the th Term Test.      Consider the following series. Answer the following questions.    Find the values of for which the series converges.    Find the sum of the series for those values of .          We can write the series as a geometric series: which converges when : i.e. the series converges on the interval .    When , the geometric series with and gives         True or False   A geometric series converges if and only if .  Justify your answer fully: give a proof if the statement is true, or a counterexample if it is false.    As a counterexample consider , which clearly diverges even though . The correct condition is .      Consider the series . Does the series converge? If so, what is the result?    We first factor out so that the powers match: Splitting off the term so that the sum starts at ,   The remaining sum is a geometric series with and . Since , it converges and , so       Find the sum of all of the convergent series.                   The factor cycles through as , so only the odd contribute, with alternating signs. Writing , This is a geometric series with and , and , so     By the constant multiple rule, . The remaining series telescopes: since , Hence the sum is .        True or False   If we manage to find the maximum value of for in the interval between and , then we can find the exact error in the Taylor polynomial approximation.  Justify your answer fully: give a proof if the statement is true, or a counterexample if it is false.    The statement is incorrect. While finding the maximum value of allows us to find an upper bound for the error, it does not give the exact error.      For the following functions, give the Taylor series generated by the function at AND give the values of for which the Taylor series converges to the given function.                  Using the Taylor series you found for in part C, find , i.e. the 12th order derivative of at .          The derivatives of at cycle through , so only even powers survive and which converges to for all .    This is the geometric series with and : which converges to exactly when , i.e. for .    We start from , valid for all , and substitute : Multiplying by , which converges to for all .    In the Taylor series , the coefficient of is . From part C, the term with occurs when , i.e. , and its coefficient is . Equating the two,          Given .   Find the 2nd order Maclaurin polynomial for .    Use Taylor's Remainder Theorem to find an upper bound on the magnitude of the error if the 2nd order Maclaurin polynomial is used to approximate for .          We compute the derivatives at : Hence     By Taylor's Remainder Theorem, Here , so . For we have , and the fraction is largest when the denominator is smallest, i.e. at : Therefore, for ,          What function has Maclaurin series ?    Factoring out of every term, and the bracket is exactly the Maclaurin series of . Hence the function is          Use a third Taylor polynomial at to approximate .    Give an upper bound for the error in using this approximation.          Let and . Then Hence and evaluating at (so ),     By Taylor's Remainder Theorem, , where bounds on . Since and is decreasing, the largest value occurs at : Therefore          Use Taylor series to evaluate     Numerator and denominator both tend to , and each vanishes to third order, so l'Hôpital's rule would have to be applied three times. Replacing each by its Maclaurin series is quicker. From and , subtracting removes the leading term of each:   Both series begin with . The limit never sees itself, so we may cancel a factor of from top and bottom: Each of the two remaining series is a power series with a nonzero constant term, so it is continuous at and the limit is just that constant term. Only the leading coefficients matter: the answer is the ratio .     *Three Maclaurin series from the binomial series    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  Use the binomial series to obtain the Maclaurin series for each of the following.    . Give every nonzero term, and say what happens to the terms beyond them.     . Give the first four terms only.     . Give the first four terms only.          Here , a positive integer: The coefficient contains the factor , so it vanishes, and so does every coefficient after it. When is a positive integer the binomial series terminates and reproduces the ordinary binomial theorem: it is a polynomial of degree , valid for every , not just for .    Here : The factors are never zero now, so the series does not terminate.    Write the radical in the denominator as a negative power, so that the binomial series applies with : With negative the signs alternate, as they did for .        *A product of two series    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  Find the first four nonzero terms of the Taylor series about for the function . Note that you may want to find these in a manner other than by direct differentiation of the function.    Differentiating the product four times is painful; multiplying two series you already know is not. The binomial series with gives and replacing by in gives   Only the constant and terms of can contribute below degree , so multiplying and collecting powers of up to ,      *How small must the separation be?    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  A dipole is often treated as a point dipole by replacing the exact axial field with its leading-order Taylor term for , Suppose this approximation must agree with the exact field to within a relative error of . If the field point is from the positive charge, how small must the charge separation be for the point-dipole approximation to be valid?    The dominant error comes from the next term in the expansion. Using , form the relative error of the leading term and keep only the largest contribution.         From the Taylor expansion, the leading term is , and the first neglected term is . The relative error of the approximation is therefore Notice that and cancel, so the relative error depends only on the ratio . Requiring this to be at most gives With , So the point-dipole approximation is accurate to only when the charges are separated by less than about at this distance consistent with the plot of the exact and approximate fields in the dipole problem of Assignment 3, where the two curves visibly merge as grows relative to .

The plane is tangent to the paraboloid at its vertex.  The solid consists of the points inside the cylinder that lie above the paraboloid and below the plane: At the center , this range for collapses to the single point , since the paraboloid already reaches the plane there.

(c) We want a unit vector satisfying two conditions at once: it must lie in the plane, and it must do no work. That is, or explicitly Subtracting the first equation from the second gives , and then , so . Taking gives the non-zero vector , whose length is . Hence one suitable unit vector is Indeed , and the opposite direction works equally well.

A. This is the set of all points whose -coordinate equals , that is . Both and are unrestricted, so it is a plane parallel to the -plane, sitting two units to the negative side of it, shown in .

E. In the -plane, is a circle of radius centered at the origin. In space is unrestricted, so the equation represents an infinitely long cylinder of radius whose axis is the -axis. Had the missing variable been instead, the axis would have been the -axis: the axis of the cylinder is always the axis of the variable that does not appear. The left half of shows this cylinder.   F. The extra condition cuts the cylinder of part E down to a piece of length , running from the circle in the plane to the circle in the plane , as on the right of . It is a tube, not a solid: the two end disks are not included, since the equation forces exactly.   Parts E and F . On the left, the infinite cylinder , whose axis is the -axis; the dashed lines indicate that it continues without bound in both directions. On the right, the same cylinder cut down to .    Two pictures side by side. On the left, a tube of radius two lying along the x axis, with dashed lines continuing past both ends to show that it is unbounded. On the right, the same tube cut off by the plane x equals zero at one end and the plane x equals five at the other, leaving a piece of length five with open ends.       G. The condition says nothing about , so whenever a point satisfies it, so does the whole vertical line through that point. In the -plane the equation describes a line through the origin, and sweeping that line vertically gives a plane: the plane containing the -axis that cuts the -plane along the line , shown in . It is not parallel to any coordinate plane, unlike part A .   Part G : the plane . It contains the -axis and meets the -plane in the line , drawn in red.    A shaded plane standing vertically and cutting diagonally through the first and third octants. It contains the z axis, and the red line where it meets the horizontal x y plane runs diagonally between the x and y axes.         A Solid Bounded by a Cylinder and a Plane   Consider the solid region bounded by the three surfaces restricted to . Describe each of the three bounding surfaces, and describe the solid region they enclose.    The equation is missing , so it is the infinite cylinder of radius whose axis is the -axis. The equation is the -plane, and is a plane tilted with respect to all three coordinate axes.  Solving the third equation for gives . Over the disk enclosed by the cylinder, this height stays positive: the largest value of on that disk is , attained in the direction , so throughout the disk. The tilted plane therefore never dips below the -plane over the region enclosed by the cylinder.  The solid is the piece of the solid cylinder lying between the flat base and the slanted lid : an oblique, truncated cylinder whose base is the disk of radius in the -plane and whose slanted top is an ellipse, shown in .   The solid bounded by , the cylinder , and the tilted plane . The disk in the -plane is the flat base, and the plane, hatched in pink, cuts the cylinder in an ellipse that forms the slanted top.    A cylinder of radius two centered on the z axis, standing on a shaded disk in the x y plane. The cylinder is sliced off at a slant by a tilted plane, hatched in pink, that meets it in an ellipse forming the top of the solid.          The vectors , and have their tails at the origin. Find the value of that will make their heads collinear.  Three points are collinear when they all lie on one straight line. Two points always do, so the condition is a condition on the third: it has to lie on the line already determined by the other two.    The heads are the points , , and , and we want all three on a single line. Two of them are already given, so the line is fixed: the line through the first two has slope For to lie on that same line, the slope from to must also be :   Equivalently, in vector language: the three heads are collinear exactly when the displacement vectors between them are parallel. Here and , and these are parallel exactly when , that is , giving again.      Two vectors and are drawn with a common tail; points up and to the right, points up and to the left, and the angle between them is slightly larger than a right angle. Sketch and clearly label a diagram showing , , and .    To make the picture concrete let us take and , which have roughly the directions described. Everything below is a statement about the geometry , so the same picture is correct for any pair of vectors in that configuration.  The difference is the vector that, added to , gives . So when and are drawn from a common tail, is the arrow that runs from the tip of   to the tip of  . (Here it is .) It is easy to get this backwards; the check is that . See .    runs from the tip of to the tip of .    A blue arrow u points up and to the right and a green arrow v points up and to the left from a common tail. An orange arrow runs from the tip of u to the tip of v, representing v minus u.          \\vec u    \\vec v    \\vec v-\\vec u                   Find the projection of on .    With and , so The negative scalar tells us the projection points opposite to , i.e. the angle between and is obtuse.      Let be the vector from to .   Find a non-zero unit vector that is orthogonal to .    Find the angle between and .       First,    (a) We need any non-zero with . Writing , the condition is This is one equation in three unknowns, so there are infinitely many answers; we just pick a convenient one. Taking gives , so , works: Finally we normalize:    (b) With we have Therefore so The angle is slightly less than a right angle, which matches the fact that the dot product is positive but small.      Let and . Find an equation for the set of all points such that is orthogonal to . Then sketch the resulting surface in three dimensions.    The two vectors are   Orthogonality means the dot product vanishes:   Now complete the square in and in :   This is the sphere of radius centred at . That centre is exactly the midpoint of and , and the radius is exactly half of . This is the three-dimensional version of the familiar fact from plane geometry: the points from which a given segment subtends a right angle form the circle having that segment as a diameter. See .   The set of points with is the sphere having as a diameter, namely .    A sphere in three dimensional space with the segment from A at zero, zero, one to B at zero, two, three drawn as a diameter. A point P is marked on the sphere and the two segments from P to A and from P to B meet at a right angle.          Two vectors and are drawn with a common tail; points up and to the right, points up and to the left, and the angle between them is slightly larger than a right angle. Sketch and clearly label a diagram showing , , and .    To make the picture concrete let us take and , which have roughly the directions described. Everything below is a statement about the geometry , so the same picture is correct for any pair of vectors in that configuration.  The projection of onto is the shadow that casts on the line through , obtained by dropping a perpendicular from the tip of to that line. Algebraically, Because the angle between and is obtuse , the dot product is negative and the projection points in the direction opposite to . This is the feature of the picture the problem is testing. See .   Since the angle between and is obtuse, points opposite to .    A blue arrow u points up and to the right and a green arrow v points up and to the left from a common tail. A short dark red arrow along the line of u points backwards, away from u, with a dashed perpendicular from the tip of v, representing the projection of v onto u.            \\vec u    \\vec v    \\operatorname{proj}_{\\vec u}\\vec v                   Suppose and are non-zero vectors satisfying and Without finding the coordinates of either vector:   Compute .    Find .    Find the angle between and .    Determine whether the angle is acute, right, or obtuse.       The whole problem rests on one idea: the square of a length is a dot product, . Expanding with the distributive property, These two identities are the algebraic form of the parallelogram in : the diagonals of the parallelogram built on and are and .   (a) Subtracting the second identity from the first makes the and terms cancel, leaving only the dot product: Substituting the two given lengths, and therefore .  It is worth pausing to check that the data are consistent. Adding the two identities instead of subtracting gives the parallelogram law, and indeed , exactly as it should be.   (b) We are told and , so A length is never negative, so .   (c) For non-zero vectors, , so and therefore    (d) Since and the lengths are positive, . Hence and the angle is obtuse . Notice that we could have answered this part immediately after part (a), without knowing either length: the sign of the dot product already decides the type of angle.   The parallelogram built on and . Its diagonals are , of length , and , of length . One short diagonal together with one long one forces the angle between the sides to be obtuse.    A parallelogram with two vectors u and v drawn from a common corner, showing the short diagonal u plus v and the long diagonal u minus v, with an obtuse angle marked between u and v.             \\theta    \\mathbf u,\\ \\|\\mathbf u\\| = 7    \\mathbf v,\\ \\|\\mathbf v\\| = 4\\sqrt3    \\mathbf u+\\mathbf v,\\ \\text{length } 5    \\mathbf u-\\mathbf v,\\ \\text{length } 13                  A remark on the data. The two diagonal lengths by themselves already determine , and the condition then follows automatically from the parallelogram law. So the individual lengths are not pinned down by that data alone: the pair , fits equally well and gives the same angle, while other splits of give different angles. This is why the extra condition is needed for parts (b) and (c).         Find the area of the triangle with vertices , , .    Find the equation of the plane containing the triangle.       Take as the base vertex and form two edge vectors: Their cross product is    The magnitude of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram spanned by and , so the triangle has half that area:     The cross product is normal to the plane, so the plane has the form . Substituting the point gives , hence          Two vectors and are drawn with a common tail; points up and to the right, points up and to the left, and the angle between them is slightly larger than a right angle. Sketch and clearly label a diagram showing , , and .    To make the picture concrete let us take and , which have roughly the directions described. Everything below is a statement about the geometry , so the same picture is correct for any pair of vectors in that configuration.  The cross product is perpendicular to both, hence perpendicular to the page. The right-hand rule (curl the fingers of the right hand from towards through the smaller angle) shows that it points out of the page , which we draw as a circle with a dot in it. Indeed, treating the vectors as lying in the -plane, and the -component is positive. Its length, , is the area of the parallelogram spanned by and . See .    points out of the page, drawn as a circle with a dot at its centre.    A blue arrow u points up and to the right and a green arrow v points up and to the left from a common tail. A circle with a dot at its centre represents u cross v, a vector pointing out of the page.           \\vec u    \\vec v    \\vec u\\times\\vec v                  *Circular Motion from a Perpendicular Force    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  Through this guided exercise, we prove that a force of constant magnitude that always points perpendicular to the velocity drives the particle around a circle. We then apply it to a charged particle in a magnetic field.  Both of the products you have met so far appear, and they do genuinely different jobs. Watch for them:   the dot product is used, through , to determine whether the speed of a particle acted upon by a perpendicular force can change,    the cross product is used to determine the direction and magnitude of the force that keeps a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field.         A particle of mass moves under a force of constant magnitude that is always perpendicular to its velocity . Show that the particle's speed is constant.    Since is perpendicular to , we have   Now consider the square of the speed, . Using the product rule for the dot product The product rule holds for the dot product just as it does for ordinary multiplication: . Taking makes the two terms equal, which gives the step used here, . and then Newton's second law , So never changes, and hence neither does the speed .   Why the dot product is the right tool here. The quantity is the rate at which the force does work on the particle. A force with a forward component speeds the particle up; a force with a backward component slows it down. Only the part of lying along can change the speed, and the dot product is exactly the mathematical tool that isolates that part. When it vanishes, can only change the direction of the velocity but not its magnitude, and so can only turn the particle, while the speed remains constant. See .   Only the component of along can change the speed. On the left that component is non-zero, so the particle speeds up; on the right , the component is zero, and the speed cannot change.    Two panels. In the left panel a force arrow leans forward over the direction of motion and its component along the velocity is drawn in green, so the dot product is non-zero and the speed changes. In the right panel the force is perpendicular to the velocity, marked with a right angle, so it has no component along the velocity, the dot product is zero, and the speed stays constant.     pathA(t) = (t, 0.09*t^2)  pathB(t) = (t + 9, 0.09*t^2)          \\vec v  \\vec F   \\text{component along }\\vec v    \\vec F\\cdot\\vec v \\ne 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{speed changes}         \\vec v  \\vec F   \\text{no component along }\\vec v    \\vec F\\cdot\\vec v = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{speed constant}                    During a short time interval , show that the direction of the velocity turns through the angle (Hint: draw the two velocity vectors, which have equal length, from a common tail.)    By the previous task the velocity never changes length; it only swings around. So and are two vectors of the same length , separated by the small angle we are after. Drawn from a common tail they form an isosceles triangle whose third side is , as in .  The tips of the two vectors both lie on a circle of radius . The straight side is the chord cutting off the arc of angle on that circle, and for a small angle a chord is very nearly the arc it subtends:   On the other hand Newton's second law over the short interval gives Equating the two expressions for , which is what we wanted. Notice the rate of turning is a constant , since , and all are: the particle swings around at a steady angular rate.   The two velocities have equal length (dashed arc), so the triangle is isosceles and the chord has length .    Two velocity arrows of equal length v are drawn from a common tail, separated by a small angle delta theta, with a dashed circular arc of radius v joining their tips to show the lengths are equal. A third arrow, delta v, runs from the first tip to the second; its length is about v times delta theta.             \\Delta\\theta    \\vec v(t)    \\vec v(t+\\Delta t)    \\Delta\\vec v    v  v   \\text{equal lengths} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\|\\Delta\\vec v\\| \\approx v\\,\\Delta\\theta    \\text{Newton:}\\; \\|\\Delta\\vec v\\| = \\tfrac{F}{m}\\Delta t \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\Delta\\theta = \\tfrac{F}{mv}\\Delta t                     Combine with the arc-length formula to prove that     In time the particle covers the arc length . If that arc bends through the angle , then the radius of the arc is defined by . Solving for and substituting both expressions,       Conclude that the trajectory is a circle.    The quantity is built from , and , every one of which is constant — because of the first task, and by hypothesis. So the path bends through equal angles over equal arc lengths, everywhere along the trajectory: its radius of curvature is the same constant at every point.  A plane curve with constant radius of curvature is a circle. Concretely, the centre of the turn always lies a fixed distance from the particle in the direction of .   The velocity is tangent to the circle and the force points straight at the centre. Equal arcs subtend equal angles , and the ratio of the two is the constant radius .    A circle of radius R centred at O. At a point on the circle the velocity arrow is tangent and the force arrow points from the particle straight in toward the centre, meeting the velocity at a right angle. Two dashed radii mark a small angle delta theta at the centre, and the arc between them, of length delta s equals R delta theta, is highlighted.           \\Delta\\theta          O  R  \\vec v  \\vec F   \\Delta s = R\\,\\Delta\\theta    \\Delta s = v\\,\\Delta t \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\Delta\\theta = \\tfrac{F}{mv}\\Delta t    \\Rightarrow\\;\\; R = \\dfrac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta\\theta} = \\dfrac{mv^2}{F} \\;\\;\\text{— a constant}                       A particle of charge enters a uniform magnetic field with its velocity perpendicular to the field. The magnetic force is Show that this force has magnitude .    The length of a cross product is , where is the angle between and . Here the velocity is perpendicular to the field, so and . Therefore Since is constant (we are about to confirm this) and is uniform, this magnitude is constant — the first hypothesis of part .      Explain why this force is always perpendicular to the velocity — not just at the initial instant, but at every moment of the motion.    This is the defining property of the cross product: is perpendicular to both factors, whatever they happen to be. So is perpendicular to automatically, at every instant, with no computation and no special assumption about where the particle is or which way it is heading.  If you would like it verified rather than quoted, the dot product does it in one line. Two facts are doing the work. First, the scalar triple product equals the determinant whose rows are , and . Second, a determinant with two equal rows is zero, since interchanging those two rows both leaves the determinant unchanged and reverses its sign. Taking ,   So such a magnetic field can never change the speed of a charged particle, no matter how strong it is. Here the magnetic force does no work and it solely changes the direction of the velocity.      Deduce that the particle moves in a circle, and find the radius of that circle.    The previous two tasks establish exactly the two hypotheses of part : the magnetic force has constant magnitude , and it is always perpendicular to the velocity. The argument of parts – therefore applies verbatim, and the particle travels in a circle at constant speed.  For the radius, put into : Equivalently, the magnetic force supplies precisely the inward force that circular motion demands: See . Faster particles and heavier particles travel on wider circles; stronger fields and larger charges wind them tighter.   A positive charge in a uniform field directed into the page. The force is perpendicular to automatically, so it never changes the speed — it only bends the path into a circle of radius .    A uniform magnetic field into the page, shown as a grid of small crosses. A positive charge travels counter-clockwise around a circle of radius r centred at O. At the rightmost point of the circle its velocity points straight up, tangent to the circle, and the magnetic force q v cross B points straight in toward the centre, at a right angle to the velocity.       \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times  \\times             O  r  \\vec v  \\vec F  q>0   \\vec B \\text{ into the page}    \\vec F = q\\,\\vec v\\times\\vec B \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\|\\vec F\\| = |q|vB, \\;\\; \\vec F\\perp\\vec v \\text{ automatically}    |q|vB = \\dfrac{mv^2}{r} \\;\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\; r = \\dfrac{mv}{|q|B}                      *Speed and direction of a projectile    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  A particle is projected from with speed at an elevation to the horizontal, as in . At time it is at the point , moving with speed in a direction making an angle with the horizontal. Show that and    A particle projected from with speed at elevation . At the point reached after time , the velocity is tangent to the path and makes an angle with the horizontal; is the depth of below the directrix.      f(x) = 0.2*x*(8 - x)      \\text{directrix}      h    \\theta  v_0     v\\cos\\phi  v\\sin\\phi    \\phi  v     O  P                         Take the origin at with horizontal and vertical axes. The coordinates of at time are The horizontal and vertical components of the velocity are the time derivatives of these, so Squaring and adding eliminates : which gives the speed at time . Dividing the vertical component by the horizontal component gives the direction, that is, .     *Free fall from the directrix    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  The directrix of the parabolic path is the horizontal line at height above . Using the previous exercise, show that the speed of the particle at is equal to the speed it would acquire by falling freely from the level of the directrix down to . That is, if denotes the depth of below the directrix (see ), then .    From the previous exercise, since is the height of . Writing this as and recognizing as the height of the directrix above , the quantity is exactly the depth of below the directrix. Hence , the square of the speed gained by falling freely through the height .     *A collision on the directrix    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  Two objects move under gravity. The first is the projectile of the two previous exercises: launched from with speed at an elevation to the horizontal. The second is a ball released from rest at a point on the directrix, the horizontal line at height above . We want the two to collide at the moment the projectile is at half of its maximum height, on the way down . See .   The projectile reaches half of its maximum height at the point on the way down. The ball is released from rest at the point vertically above on the directrix, and falls the depth to meet it.     f(x) = 0.55*x*(8 - x)  C = (6.83, 4.4)      \\text{directrix } y = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g}     \\text{projectile}      H  \\frac{H}{2}       h   B  C  O                   Show that the projectile is at half of its maximum height at the two times and say which of these is on the descending branch.    The vertical motion is . It is greatest when , that is at , which gives the maximum height Setting gives the quadratic equation whose discriminant is . Hence These straddle the apex time symmetrically, as they must. The descending crossing is the later one,       Find the point on the directrix from which the ball must be released.    Released from rest, the ball has no horizontal velocity, so it falls along a vertical line: must be directly above the collision point . The projectile's horizontal coordinate at time is so the release point is In terms of the range this is comfortably past the apex at and short of the landing point, as shows.      Find how long after the projectile is launched the ball must be released.    The depth of below the directrix is Falling from rest through takes a time with , so The ball must therefore be released seconds after the projectile is launched.      Show that at the instant of the collision the two objects have exactly the same speed.    By , a projectile at depth below its directrix has speed . The ball starts from rest on the directrix and has fallen the same depth , so its speed is The two are equal. This is not a coincidence of our particular choice of : the projectile always carries exactly the speed it would have gained by falling freely from the directrix, and the ball is doing precisely that fall. Wherever on the path we arrange the collision, the two objects meet with the same speed, here Their directions of course differ: the ball moves straight down, while the projectile moves down and forward at the angle of .      Is always positive? Find the elevations for which the ball is released after the projectile is launched, and explain what a negative would mean.    Requiring means and squaring gives , that is For flatter launches the required release time is negative: the ball would have to be dropped before the projectile is fired, because a shallow trajectory reaches its (low) half-height point sooner than the ball can fall the long way down from the directrix.      puts the whole scenario in motion: the projectile rises to , the ball is released from at the time , the two meet at , and the velocity arrows there have the same length.     Animation: the projectile and the ball, released from rest on the directrix, collide at half of the maximum height with equal speeds.         Consider the curve of intersection of the surfaces and .   Parametrize the curve.    Find the projection of the curve onto the -plane, and give a Cartesian equation for it.        (a) The first surface does not involve ; dividing by , which is an ellipse in the -plane with semi-axes (in ) and (in ). It is parametrized by , . The second surface simply forces , so    (b) Projecting onto the -plane just means forgetting the -coordinate, so the projected curve is parametrized by the first two components alone, To turn that into a Cartesian equation, eliminate with : The shadow is an ellipse in the -plane with semi-axes in the -direction and in the -direction. This is the same ellipse we started from in the -plane, which is no accident: the plane carries the -coordinate over to the -coordinate unchanged.      Find the intersection of the line and the plane .    The parametric equations of the line are Substituting into the equation of the plane, and , , . The intersection is the point .      Find the distance between the two planes     Dividing the second equation by gives , so both planes have the same normal vector and are therefore parallel . (They are distinct, since .)  Pick any point on the first plane, say , and any point on the second, say . Then , and the distance between the planes is the length of the projection of onto :       Find the angle between the planes and .

Two vectors lying in are A normal vector is their cross product: Note , which will be convenient. Using the point , the plane is (Check: gives and gives .)   (a) The closest point of a plane to a given point is the foot of the perpendicular from , which we reach by moving from in the direction of the normal. So consider and find the value of for which this point lies on : Therefore the closest point is (Check: .) Incidentally, the distance from to is . See .   Schematic picture of .

A normal arrow runs from Q up to the foot of the perpendicular on the plane, and a second line through Q is drawn parallel to the plane, never meeting it.       (b) A line never crosses the plane exactly when it is parallel to and does not lie in it. Since is not on (we saw ), we only need the direction vector to be perpendicular to the normal:   The extra requirement forces the two lines and to agree for all , which happens exactly when . Substituting , Choosing and gives , and the line is Indeed for every , and , so the line is parallel to and, starting from a point off , never reaches it.     *A Parabolic Antenna    Starred problem. This one is for the interested reader. It will not be examined.  A parabolic antenna has the shape of a paraboloid of revolution: it is created by rotating part of a parabola around its axis. By the reflection property, all signals arriving parallel to the axis are concentrated at the focus after reflecting off the dish, so that is where the receiver is mounted. The axial cross-section of the dish is described by two measurements: the diameter  of the dish and its depth  . Placing the vertex at the origin with the dish opening upward, the cross-section is the parabola , and the rim passes through the points .  Consider a dish antenna with diameter cm and depth cm, suitable for the amateur radio band at GHz.   Cross-section of the parabolic antenna: diameter , depth , focus , and opening angle .    A parabola opening upward with vertex at the origin. The rim points at (minus d over 2, h) and (d over 2, h) are joined by a horizontal double arrow labeled d. A vertical double arrow labeled h shows the depth from the rim down to the axis level. The focus F(0,p) lies on the y axis above the rim, and two segments run from the focus to the rim points, enclosing the opening angle two phi.     d = 120  h = 20.3  p = d^2\/(16*h)  f(x) = x^2\/(4*p)        2\\varphi    d   h   \\left(-\\tfrac{d}{2},\\,h\\right)    \\left(\\tfrac{d}{2},\\,h\\right)    F(0,p)                        Determine the optimal location for the receiver, that is, find the distance from the vertex of the dish to the focus.    The receiver must sit at the focus . The rim point lies on the parabola , so   The receiver should be mounted on the axis about cm above the vertex of the dish. Note that here, so the focus sits above the rim of this shallow dish.      Find the quadratic function (explicit form) that describes the curvature of the dish, and graph it (for example, in GeoGebra or Desmos).    Solving for with gives   The graph captures the true curvature of the dish provided both axes use the same scale.      The opening angle  of the dish is the angle at which the two edges of the rim are seen from the focus. Compute it.    The focus , the point , and the rim point form a right triangle with legs (vertical) and (horizontal), and is the angle at the focus.

Identify and sketch the surface .    Dividing by , we can rewrite the equation as which forces , i.e. or . Let us look at the traces:   Intersection with the plane : , a hyperbola.    Intersection with the plane : ; when , we have ellipses as intersections.    Intersection with the plane : , a hyperbola.   The surface is a hyperboloid of two sheets along the -axis, with vertices and . See .   The hyperboloid of two sheets : two bowl-shaped sheets opening along the -axis, with vertices at .    Two bowl shaped surfaces in a three dimensional coordinate system, opening away from each other along the horizontal y axis. The left sheet has its vertex at zero comma negative two comma zero and opens to the left; the right sheet has its vertex at zero comma two comma zero and opens to the right. Each sheet ends in an ellipse.         Which of These Are Hyperboloids?   None of the equations below is in standard position. Complete the square where necessary, then select every equation whose surface is a hyperboloid, of one sheet or of two.       Correct. Completing the square gives : one negative square, equal to a positive constant, so a hyperboloid of one sheet.       No. This is — every square is positive, so it is an ellipsoid.       Correct. Two negative squares against a positive constant gives a hyperboloid of two sheets.       No — and this is the trap. It has the same signs as the first option, but it equals rather than a positive constant. That degenerates the hyperboloid into an elliptic cone , the surface the two families of hyperboloids approach asymptotically.       No. The word hyperbolic is a red herring: this is linear in , so it is a hyperbolic paraboloid (a saddle) with vertex at , not a hyperboloid.      Completing the square in the first and second, Reading off the signs: one negative square against is a hyperboloid of one sheet; two negative squares against is a hyperboloid of two sheets. So the first and third are hyperboloids. The second is an ellipsoid, the fourth equals and so is a cone, and the fifth is linear in and so is a hyperbolic paraboloid.     Graphing a Parabolic Cylinder   Sketch the graph of over the rectangle , in the -plane. Why is this surface called a parabolic cylinder ?    Since the equation does not involve , every cross-section of the surface at a fixed value of is the same parabola in the -plane, opening downward from its vertex at . Sliding that parabola along the -axis from to sweeps out the surface.  Over , the parabola satisfies , with equality exactly at , so the surface touches the -plane along the two edges of the rectangular region and rises to a maximum height of along the ridge . Because it is generated by sliding a fixed curve along a straight line, rather than curving in the direction as well, it is called a parabolic cylinder , shown in .   The parabolic cylinder over the rectangle , . Every slice at a fixed is the same downward-opening parabola.    A curved sheet shaped like a downward opening parabola in the x z plane, extended without change along the y direction over a rectangular region in the x y plane, forming an arched, tunnel-like surface.         A Solid Bounded by a Cylinder and a Paraboloid   Consider the solid bounded by the three surfaces    Describe each of the three bounding surfaces.    Describe the solid region they enclose.    Describe the cross-section of the solid in the plane .        (a) The equation is the -plane. The equation is a paraboloid opening upward from its vertex at the origin. The equation is missing , so it is the infinite cylinder of radius whose axis is the -axis. The paraboloid meets that cylinder exactly where , at height .   (b) The solid consists of the points inside the cylinder lying between the flat base and the paraboloid: Near the -axis this range for is almost nothing, since there, while at the rim it is the full interval . The solid is therefore shaped like a shallow bowl carved out from underneath the paraboloid: thin at the center and rising to its full height at the cylinder wall, shown in .   (c) Setting restricts the solid's defining inequalities to and : the region under the parabola , above the -axis, between and , shown in .

The solid fills the region under the paraboloid, thin near the -axis and reaching full height where the paraboloid meets the cylinder wall.    A paraboloid opening upward from the origin, shown as a shaded bowl sitting inside a cylindrical wall of radius two. The bowl's rim meets the top of the cylinder, and a shaded disk in the x y plane forms the flat base of the solid beneath the bowl.          Which Identity Fails?   Exactly one of the following is not valid for all vectors in . Which one?         This one is valid. Both sides equal the determinant with rows , so the dot and the cross may be interchanged.         Correct — the cross product is not associative . Take and . Then The left side lies in the plane of and ; the right side lies in the plane of and . There is no reason for those to agree.         This one is valid — the cross product is distributive over addition. (It is only associativity that fails.)         This one is valid: it is the BAC-CAB triple product expansion. It looks the most exotic of the four, which is exactly why it is worth remembering that it is true.       Distance Between Skew Lines   Consider the two lines They are skew. Let be the direction vectors and let join a point of to a point of .  The absolute value of the scalar triple product equals .  The distance between the two lines, to three decimal places, is .      Correct.     Nearly — the triple product itself is , but the question asks for its absolute value .       Correct.     That is , the denominator . You still need to divide the triple product by it.      You appear to have divided by rather than by .       The vector is perpendicular to both lines, so the distance is the length of the projection of onto it: .    With and , Taking ,      Why a Magnetic Field Cannot Change a Particle's Speed   Arrange the steps below into a correct proof that the magnetic force does no work, and therefore that a charged particle in a magnetic field moves at constant speed.      Let a particle of mass and charge move with velocity through a magnetic field .    The force on the particle is .    By definition, a cross product is perpendicular to both of its factors, so is perpendicular to .    Hence .    The kinetic energy satisfies .    Therefore , so is constant: the field changes the particle's direction but never its speed.     "

Through this guided exercise, we prove that a force of constant magnitude that always points perpendicular to the velocity drives the particle around a circle. We then apply it to a charged particle in a magnetic field.  Both of the products you have met so far appear, and they do genuinely different jobs. Watch for them:   the dot product is used, through , to determine whether the speed of a particle acted upon by a perpendicular force can change,    the cross product is used to determine the direction and magnitude of the force that keeps a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field.         A particle of mass moves under a force of constant magnitude that is always perpendicular to its velocity . Show that the particle's speed is constant.    Since is perpendicular to , we have   Now consider the square of the speed, . Using the product rule for the dot product The product rule holds for the dot product just as it does for ordinary multiplication: . Taking makes the two terms equal, which gives the step used here, . and then Newton's second law , So never changes, and hence neither does the speed .   Why the dot product is the right tool here. The quantity is the rate at which the force does work on the particle. A force with a forward component speeds the particle up; a force with a backward component slows it down. Only the part of lying along can change the speed, and the dot product is exactly the mathematical tool that isolates that part. When it vanishes, can only change the direction of the velocity but not its magnitude, and so can only turn the particle, while the speed remains constant. See .   Only the component of along can change the speed. On the left that component is non-zero, so the particle speeds up; on the right , the component is zero, and the speed cannot change.    Two panels. In the left panel a force arrow leans forward over the direction of motion and its component along the velocity is drawn in green, so the dot product is non-zero and the speed changes. In the right panel the force is perpendicular to the velocity, marked with a right angle, so it has no component along the velocity, the dot product is zero, and the speed stays constant.     pathA(t) = (t, 0.09*t^2)  pathB(t) = (t + 9, 0.09*t^2)          \\vec v  \\vec F   \\text{component along }\\vec v    \\vec F\\cdot\\vec v \\ne 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{speed changes}         \\vec v  \\vec F   \\text{no component along }\\vec v    \\vec F\\cdot\\vec v = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\text{speed constant}                    During a short time interval , show that the direction of the velocity turns through the angle (Hint: draw the two velocity vectors, which have equal length, from a common tail.)    By the previous task the velocity never changes length; it only swings around. So and are two vectors of the same length , separated by the small angle we are after. Drawn from a common tail they form an isosceles triangle whose third side is , as in .  The tips of the two vectors both lie on a circle of radius . The straight side is the chord cutting off the arc of angle on that circle, and for a small angle a chord is very nearly the arc it subtends:   On the other hand Newton's second law over the short interval gives Equating the two expressions for , which is what we wanted. Notice the rate of turning is a constant , since , and all are: the particle swings around at a steady angular rate.   The two velocities have equal length (dashed arc), so the triangle is isosceles and the chord has length .    Two velocity arrows of equal length v are drawn from a common tail, separated by a small angle delta theta, with a dashed circular arc of radius v joining their tips to show the lengths are equal. A third arrow, delta v, runs from the first tip to the second; its length is about v times delta theta.             \\Delta\\theta    \\vec v(t)    \\vec v(t+\\Delta t)    \\Delta\\vec v    v  v   \\text{equal lengths} \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\|\\Delta\\vec v\\| \\approx v\\,\\Delta\\theta    \\text{Newton:}\\; \\|\\Delta\\vec v\\| = \\tfrac{F}{m}\\Delta t \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\Delta\\theta = \\tfrac{F}{mv}\\Delta t                     Combine with the arc-length formula to prove that     In time the particle covers the arc length .

The quantity is built from , and , every one of which is constant — because of the first task, and by hypothesis. So the path bends through equal angles over equal arc lengths, everywhere along the trajectory: its radius of curvature is the same constant at every point.  A plane curve with constant radius of curvature is a circle. Concretely, the centre of the turn always lies a fixed distance from the particle in the direction of .

Explain why this force is always perpendicular to the velocity — not just at the initial instant, but at every moment of the motion.    This is the defining property of the cross product: is perpendicular to both factors, whatever they happen to be. So is perpendicular to automatically, at every instant, with no computation and no special assumption about where the particle is or which way it is heading.  If you would like it verified rather than quoted, the dot product does it in one line. Two facts are doing the work. First, the scalar triple product equals the determinant whose rows are , and . Second, a determinant with two equal rows is zero, since interchanging those two rows both leaves the determinant unchanged and reverses its sign. Taking ,   So such a magnetic field can never change the speed of a charged particle, no matter how strong it is. Here the magnetic force does no work and it solely changes the direction of the velocity.      Deduce that the particle moves in a circle, and find the radius of that circle.    The previous two tasks establish exactly the two hypotheses of part : the magnetic force has constant magnitude , and it is always perpendicular to the velocity. The argument of parts – therefore applies verbatim, and the particle travels in a circle at constant speed.  For the radius, put into : Equivalently, the magnetic force supplies precisely the inward force that circular motion demands: See . Faster particles and heavier particles travel on wider circles; stronger fields and larger charges wind them tighter.   A positive charge in a uniform field directed into the page. The force is perpendicular to automatically, so it never changes the speed — it only bends the path into a circle of radius .

Hence These straddle the apex time symmetrically, as they must. The descending crossing is the later one,       Find the point on the directrix from which the ball must be released.    Released from rest, the ball has no horizontal velocity, so it falls along a vertical line: must be directly above the collision point . The projectile's horizontal coordinate at time is so the release point is In terms of the range this is comfortably past the apex at and short of the landing point, as shows.      Find how long after the projectile is launched the ball must be released.    The depth of below the directrix is Falling from rest through takes a time with , so The ball must therefore be released seconds after the projectile is launched.      Show that at the instant of the collision the two objects have exactly the same speed.    By , a projectile at depth below its directrix has speed . The ball starts from rest on the directrix and has fallen the same depth , so its speed is The two are equal. This is not a coincidence of our particular choice of : the projectile always carries exactly the speed it would have gained by falling freely from the directrix, and the ball is doing precisely that fall. Wherever on the path we arrange the collision, the two objects meet with the same speed, here Their directions of course differ: the ball moves straight down, while the projectile moves down and forward at the angle of .      Is always positive? Find the elevations for which the ball is released after the projectile is launched, and explain what a negative would mean.    Requiring means and squaring gives , that is For flatter launches the required release time is negative: the ball would have to be dropped before the projectile is fired, because a shallow trajectory reaches its (low) half-height point sooner than the ball can fall the long way down from the directrix.      puts the whole scenario in motion: the projectile rises to , the ball is released from at the time , the two meet at , and the velocity arrows there have the same length.

The interpretation: at the point , if the ant moves in the positive -direction while its -coordinate stays fixed, the temperature increases at a rate of about per foot.   (b) By definition , so we compute at two different values of and then take a difference quotient in . We already have , and in the same way Therefore The units are degrees Fahrenheit per foot per foot, i.e. . This says that as we move in the -direction, the rate at which the temperature rises in the -direction is itself decreasing.   (c) First we find the value of at which the ant is at .

Justify your answer fully: give a proof if the statement is true, or a counterexample if it is false.    We would have to show the limit agrees on every path, but this is not feasible.      Show that the limit does not exist:     Approaching the limit along the -axis, i.e. , we need to consider which does not exist since the numerator has limit but the denominator has limit .      Evaluate the following limit or show that the limit does not exist:     Along the line : Along the line : Since , the limit does not exist.      Show that the following limit does not exist:     Along , we have hence approaches zero as along the line . Along , we have and hence as along .

Since ,       A metal plate is placed on the -plane in such a way that the temperature at any point is given by  C.   What is the rate of change in temperature at in the direction of ?    At , in what direction is the temperature increasing most rapidly?    At , in what direction is the temperature decreasing most rapidly?          We first compute the gradient: so . The direction vector is with , so the unit vector is . Hence     The temperature increases most rapidly in the direction of the gradient:     The temperature decreases most rapidly in the direction opposite to the gradient:          Calculate the maximum rate of change of at the point and determine the direction in which it occurs.    The gradient is so at , The direction of maximum increase is and the maximum rate of increase is       Consider the function .   Find the directions in which increases and decreases most rapidly at .    Find the derivatives of in these directions at .          The gradient is The function increases most rapidly in the direction of the gradient, and decreases most rapidly in the opposite direction,     The directional derivatives are As expected, the largest possible rate of change is and the smallest is .         In the -plane, the temperature at the point is given by . You're at where the temperature is . Brrrr!   In what direction should you go, from , in order to warm up the fastest?    What is the directional derivative in that direction at the point ?    If you walk units in that direction, by about how many degrees will you warm up?          A function increases fastest in the direction of its gradient: So head in the direction (equivalently, the unit vector ).    In the direction of the gradient, the directional derivative equals the length of the gradient:     The directional derivative is the rate of change of temperature per unit of distance travelled, so by the linear approximation          A sheet of metal of varying density occupies the -plane. At the point , the density is . We move away from the point in the direction . Use the directional derivative to estimate about how far we'll have to go for the density to increase by .    Let . Then The given direction is already a unit vector, since , so   So the density increases at about units of density per unit of distance. To gain units of density we therefore need to travel approximately     The problem that closes this set repeats the three questions of in a different physical setting: find the direction of most rapid decrease, the rate along a prescribed direction, and the directions of no change.   The Fall Line on a Ski Slope   A mountainside has elevation, in feet, with and in feet. A skier stands at . Her gravitational potential energy is , so the downhill force she feels is a positive multiple of .     Find the fall line , the unit vector of steepest descent, and the grade of the slope there, expressed as a percent (feet dropped per hundred feet travelled).    A traverse is a route on which she neither climbs nor descends. Find the two unit vectors that accomplish this.    She wants a gentler line of exactly grade. Using , find the angle between her heading and the fall line.           , so . Steepest descent is along , and , a grade of about .     , tangent to the contour line of constant elevation through .     , so off the fall line, on either side.       Part (a) says the grade is . Here is what that number is, on the hill itself. The vertical plane through in the direction cuts the surface in the gold curve; the red line is that curve's tangent at ; and is the angle it makes with the horizontal. Since , the grade is the tangent of that angle. Swing with the slider: is largest along the fall line, where and , and it closes to nothing along the contour, where the tangent line lies flat.       The mountainside . Compare the fall line, the level traverse, and the line. Watch the grade readout drift away from as the skier leaves , since the angle in part (c) is computed at only.          You measure the magnitude of a force to be , but there could be an error of at most . You measure a mass to be with an error of at most . You are trying to use these two to approximate the magnitude of the acceleration . We have . Use the principle of the differential to find an upper bound on the absolute value of the error when assuming .    Treat as a function of the two measured quantities, . Its differential is At the measured values and (where indeed ), the coefficients are and .  Taking absolute values and using the triangle inequality with the worst-case errors and , So the error in the value is at most about .      Let , and note that . Use an appropriate partial derivative to approximate .    Only changes, by , so we need . Treating as a constant and using the chain rule,   At the point we have and , so   Therefore The exact value is , so again the approximation is quite good.      True or False   If every directional derivative exists at a point , then must be continuous at .  Justify your answer fully: give a proof if the statement is true, or a counterexample if it is false.    False, and the failure is dramatic. Let For a unit vector with , and when . So every directional derivative exists. Yet along the parabola , which depends on — different parabolas approach different values, so does not exist and is not continuous at the origin. Existence of directional derivatives is a statement about behavior along straight lines only; continuity requires control along every approach.     Find the Error   Below is a student's computation of the derivative of at the point in the direction of . Exactly one line contains the error. Click on that line.    The error is in the third line. The formula requires a unit vector. Since , the correct direction is , giving not . Lines 1, 2 and 4 are each correct given the line before them — line 4 faithfully reports the (wrong) number produced by line 3.       So the directional derivative equals .    "
